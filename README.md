#Â *Whaaaat*?

The choice of a name is a [treasure hunt];
it's both *frustrating* and *fun* at the same time!

We were in a (*potential client*) Meeting on Thursday
discussing a project that *could* require some *creativity*
when someone mentioned a company being  
[*sued*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit) ...

e.g:

as I was cycling home the cogs started turning in my brain ...

Consider the "*News Headline*":

> *"ABC corp." sues "XYZ inc." for ...*

what would we need to call our organisation/company
to *eliminate* the possibility of ever incurring any legal action.

> **Note**: We are not *considering* nor would
*ever* contemplate doing anything illegal!  
I cannot stress this strongly enough ...  
This is a ***thought/research exercise*** intended to spark
creativity in the same way that *any* novelist
needs to *understand* her *character* to make the story convincing.  
However ... having seen how *litigeous*
[***patent trolls***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll)
(who neither *create useful things* nor *benefit society* in *any way*)
are when they see an opportunity to make a *quick buck*,
this might actually be a *useful* exploration ...
> Also, given that there are still *many*
[***grey areas***](http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/19/fintech-startups-navigate-legal-gray-areas-to-build-billion-dollar-companies/)
in Technology, where ***morally defensible*** activities
can be outlawed for a *fee* (*hire expensive lawyers and nothing is impossible*...) this might be *real* for anyone approaching
any level of "*success*"...

So, you see, there really was only *one* name we could chose.
and it had to involve a word that no one could *ever*
***conceivably*** take *any* offense from.
Even people who ***hate*** cats aren't going to
let their name be in a *news headline* stating that ...

Don't believe me?
